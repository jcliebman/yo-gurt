    Soccer Duel, a 1v1 soccer game created by Felix Figueroa. Heavy players tend
    to win the ball in duels, and they have the best shooting stats. Light players
    are crazy fast, but they are weak and have poor shooting. Normal players are
    average, running and shooting well, but they have no special advantage. 
    Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your device and unzip soccergame.zip.
